### We are very pleased to share the practical results of this course. If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment. Additionally, if you have any related materials or personal notes from this course, we would also welcome your sharing.
### Tips:
#### 1. These codes include the specific applications of CNN and LSTM in binary classification and regression problems.
#### 2. For a simple binary classification problem, we recommend comparing the performance of a two-layer convolutional network and a three-layer convolutional network to determine which network architecture works best.

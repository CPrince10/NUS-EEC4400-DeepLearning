### About use of jupyter notebookï¼š
1. #### first, remember to configure your tensorflow virtual environment according to the configuration file.

2. #### Since this is a group task, your group can share a virtual environment for collaborative development by opening ports through jupyter notebook.

   1. ##### about the operation of jupyter notebook:

      1. First activate the virtual environment.
      2. open jupyter notebook in the directory of the virtual environment
      3. pycharm connect to the appropriate port number. 4.
      4. Open the python file in the server directory and make sure the directory is the same as the one in your browser.
      5. Bind the ports with the bind all command.

   2. ##### In co-development, there are pop-up windows: disk file changes, overwrite or revert?

      1. Overwrite: a rewrite operation, i.e., overwrite the previous version with your current version to become the latest version. 2.

      2. Revert: reload operation, that is, reload someone else's file to become the file you are currently displaying.

         Warning: Since jupyter only supports one person editing a file for a period of time, in order to prevent losing the changes made, it is recommended to have only one person editing the file for a period of time, and to save the creation point in time as soon as the editing is finished.
### Tips:
#### 1. These codes include the specific applications of CNN and LSTM in binary classification and regression problems.
#### 2. For a simple binary classification problem, we recommend comparing the performance of a two-layer convolutional network and a three-layer convolutional network to determine which network architecture works best.
